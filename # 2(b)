b) Accounting method:
Assign a cost of 3 units to each insertion operation.
For simple operations (no resizing):
- Actual cost: 1 unit
- 2 units are saved in the "bank"
For complex operations (resizing):
- Actual cost: i units, where i is the current number of elements
- The saved units from previous operations are used to pay for this cost
Simple ops have O(3) amortized cost and O(1) actual cost
Complex ops (at ith index) have O(i) amortized and O(i) actual cost
Follow the sequence of operations:
- After 3 simple ops: Bank balance = $6 (3+3+3-1-1-1)
- After a complex op at index 4: Bank balance = $2 (6-4)
- After 3 more simple ops: Bank balance = $8 ($2+$6)
- After a complex op at index 8: Bank balance = $0 (8-8)
- After 9 simple ops: Bank balance = $18
- A complex op at index 18 can now be performed
This pattern continues, always maintaining a non-negative bank balance.
The accounting method demonstrates that by charging 3 units for each operation: always have enough "saved" to cover the cost of resizing operations; the bank balance never becomes negative; the amortized cost per operation is O(1)
